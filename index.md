# <a name="bio"></a>Short Bio

I am a third-year PhD student in Department of 
[Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu)
at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu).
I am co-advised by 
Prof. [David Gleich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/)
and Prof. [Luo Si](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lsi/).
Before Joining Purdue, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics
from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) (USTC).

### Research Interests

Machine Learning, Matrix Network Computation, Data Mining and Information Retrieval.
